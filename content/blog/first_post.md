Dear Brookside Leadership,

First, I just wanted to mention what a joy it was to be back at Brookside and visit some of our dear friends that we came to love and enjoy during our time at Brookside. As you all know, church planting is a difficult task, and it was certainly refreshing to have a weekend of rest as we worshipped with you a couple of weeks ago.

It has also come to my attention that some allegations against Pastor Ken's integrity have been lobbied against him over the past few months, which have recently grown in intensity. This news was undoubtedly discouraging to hear as Brookside is a church filled with believers who desire to gather, worship, and honor the Lord. It is also a perfectly positioned church to reach the needy area of Milwaukee. However, to serve God's people and reach Brookside's neighboring communities, there must come a time when there is a commitment made to stand behind Pastor Ken and his vision for moving forward.

I know that may sound odd since I chose to leave and engage in ministry at another church. However, I did want to write and affirm that my reasons for moving on did not have to do with any concerns I had with Pastor Ken's integrity.

I believe the Lord called me away for several reasons:
1. As I spent more time in ministry, I had an increasing burden to serve a more vital role in discipleship and preaching. When I was there, nine pastors were on staff, and I perceived that any opportunities for upward mobility and involvement in those aspects of ministry were not available.
2. I observed the beginnings of unrest as allegations about the preaching competencies of our pastors (including my own) came under attack by some in leadership. I found it challenging to grow spiritually and lead my family when there was not a settled agreement on the fact that the preaching pastors I served with all loved the Lord, were faithful to exegetical preaching, and had a passion for seeing His people discipled. Without this settled unity, I could not see my family thriving into the future.
3. As I observed the area of Chapel Hill, I saw Apple and Google moving into the Research Triangle, which is bringing exponential growth and opportunities to reach people with the gospel. As Pastor Bill Jones says, "It is an amazing thing when the Lord brings the world to your door to share the gospel with them."
4. I also observed a unified team at Chapel Hill Baptist Church who was ready to rally around a single vision, not only in word but in power (1 Corinthians 4:20).

With all that being said, over the years I worked with Pastor Ken, I was privileged to observe and learn from his example of love for the body of Christ. I watched as he repeatedly laid aside his own desires and needs for the needs of the body. While no one is perfect, you cannot deny the value of a church leader who truly loves the people the Lord has entrusted to him.

When our world is so uncertain, I would encourage the leadership at Brookside to be a beacon of certainty as there is nothing more sure than the wealth we have been given in Christ. There is no more excellent vision to rally around than to see the greater Milwaukee area impacted by the gospel's transforming power.

Pastor Ken, do not be afraid to lead courageously based on the needs of the church people God has gifted to your care, and deacons, do not be afraid to follow the vision laid out by a pastor who has stuck by you through so much.

Chapel Hill Baptist Church also covets your prayers for wisdom as we seek the Lord's will and look forward to His provision as we continue to look for a permanent location to serve here.

Sincerely,  
-Pastor Bryce
