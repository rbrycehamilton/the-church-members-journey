      <description>Dear Brookside Leadership,
First, I just wanted to mention what a joy it was to be back at Brookside and visit some of our dear friends that we came to love and enjoy during our time at Brookside. As you all know, church planting is a difficult task, and it was certainly refreshing to have a weekend of rest as we worshipped with you a couple of weeks ago.
It has also come to my attention that some allegations against Pastor Ken&amp;rsquo;s integrity have been lobbied against him over the past few months, which have recently grown in intensity.</description>
